## 🎮 How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player O goes first.
Players alternate turns by clicking on empty boxes.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the round.
If all 9 boxes are filled and no one wins, the round is declared a draw.
Use "Next Round" to play again or "Reset" to restart scores.
